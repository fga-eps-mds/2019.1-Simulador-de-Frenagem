#### How use issues

#### Creating your branches

The first pass to create your branch is define a name, the pattern followed in our project is:

```
"<issue number>-<first-name>-<second name separated with - >"
```

All branches will be created from devel branch.

When you are creating branches stay tuned in:

* The language used in the project is English

* Commit just files related with your commit and issue
