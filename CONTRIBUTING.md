## How to contribute

If you want to contribute with that project the first stage is create a issue in github, that issue will be linked with your branch as defined in [How propose your changes](). All issues is handled using [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/).

#### How use issues

To tracking all project UnBrake use issues to tasking control. To create issues more easily we have some templates in github, answer all questions and most part it will be alright.

Besides that a issue all issues must have:
* All decisions about a issue have to be in the issue body
* Always have to be a person assinged in issues
* Tracking labels labels

Just task issues have to be:
* A epic
* Estimate number
* Milestone

#### Creating your branches

The first pass to create your branch is define a name, the pattern followed in our project is:

```
"<issue number>-<first-name>-<second name separated with - >"
```

All branches will be created from devel branch.

When you are creating branches stay tuned in:

* The language used in the project is English
* A branch is always linked with a issue
* Commit just files related with your commit and issue
